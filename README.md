## Hi there 👋

I'm a **Flutter Developer** passionate about building high-quality mobile apps, polished UI/UX, and high-performance systems.

- 📱 I built [**Slova**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vocabulary-learning-slova/id6741756227), a language-learning app built in flutter focused on learning through real sentences and spaced repetition.
- 🪙 I really enjoy working on UI/UX and motion, so I created a [**Flutter Banking App UI Demo**](https://github.com/andreykuzovlevv/banking-app-demo) to explore complex layouts, custom widgets, and fluid staggered animations.
- 🤖 I'm also fascinated by AI, which led me to build my own [**chess engine + game UI**](https://github.com/andreykuzovlevv/TinyHouse-Chess-AI) inspired by Stockfish — for the TinyHouse chess variant.
