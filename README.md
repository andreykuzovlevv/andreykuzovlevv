## Hi there 👋

I'm a **Flutter Developer** passionate about building high-quality mobile apps, polished UI/UX, and high-performance systems.

### 📱 My App
I built **Slova**, a language-learning app built in flutter focused on learning through real sentences and spaced repetition:

### 🎨 UI & Animations
I really enjoy working on UI/UX and motion, so I created a **Flutter Banking App UI Demo** to explore complex layouts, custom widgets, and fluid staggered animations:

### ♟️ AI
I'm also fascinated by AI, which led me to build my own **chess engine + game UI** inspired by Stockfish — for the TinyHouse chess variant:  
[💻 https://github.com/andreykuzovlevv/TinyHouse-Chess-AI](https://github.com/andreykuzovlevv/TinyHouse-Chess-AI)

It’s a **C++ engine with custom search logic** and an **SDL3 desktop UI** to play against the AI — and it beats me more often than I’d like 😄
